# Welcome to Columbia Radio Astronomy Consortium (CRAC)!

We are a group of undergraduate students at Columbia University interested in bulding and developing a radio telescope.
Contrary to ordinary optical telescopes, radio telescopes require sophisticated hardward and software development before one can 
begin making observations. 


Here you will find our preliminary methods of bulding the telescope alongside with a data pipeline writen in Arduino (Tzanidakis et al. 2017) 


For more information about the project please contact Anastasios Tzanidakis at at3156@columbia.edu
